	<LongDescription># Smooth Left-Hand Traffic (Experimental) 
This mod adjusts building prefabs to better support **Left-Hand Traffic (LHT)** cities.
It **flips each building’s internal roads** and driveways when loading LHT saves so that **entrances and exits match the traffic direction** — preventing vehicle crossovers and twisted internal paths.

Works with **all building assets**, including mod ones.
Some mods already include separate LHT and RHT versions (for example, [Overground Parking by Dome](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/81913/Windows));
those will keep their original layout to avoid visual conflicts.



## Experimental Notice
This mod is still in testing.
Some assets may have:
- unreachable internal paths,
- or incorrectly flipped models that cause placement conflicts.
- or ground arrows that display incorrectly after flipping (this does **not affect gameplay** and you can manually fix decals).

Known problematic assets are already excluded, but if you encounter more, please leave feedback, so I can update the list.

**Note:** Buildings **already placed** in your city will need to be **replaced** for the changes to take effect.



## Tips
- If you temporarily need **RHT** buildings, go to Developer Mode → Gameplay tab,
uncheck LeftHand Traffic, place the building, then re-enable it.
- The mod only affects **Left-Hand Traffic saves** — Right-Hand saves are **unaffected**.
- You can **freely switch** between LHT and RHT saves **without restarting or disabling** the mod.



### Credits
- Implementation inspired by **StarQ**’s mod example.
