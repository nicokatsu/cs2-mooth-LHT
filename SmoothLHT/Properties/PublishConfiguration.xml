        # 🚗 Smooth Left-Hand Traffic (Experimental)

        This mod adjusts **building prefabs** to better support **Left-Hand Traffic (LHT)** cities.
        It automatically flips each building’s internal roads and driveways so that entrances and exits match the traffic direction — preventing vehicle crossovers and twisted internal paths.

        Works with **all building assets**, including mod ones.
        Some mods already include separate LHT and RHT versions (for example, [Overground Parking by Dome](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/81913/Windows));
        those will keep their original layout to avoid visual conflicts.

        ## ⚠️ Experimental Notice
        This mod is still in testing.
        Some assets may have:
        - unreachable internal paths,
        - or incorrectly flipped models that cause placement conflicts.
        - or ground arrows that display incorrectly after flipping (this does **not affect gameplay** and you can manually edit decals).

        Known problematic assets are already excluded, but if you encounter new ones, please leave feedback, so I can update the list.
        ➡️ **Note:** Buildings already placed in your city will need to be **replaced** for the changes to take effect.

        ## 💡 Tips
        - If you temporarily need **RHT** buildings, open **Developer Mode → Gameplay tab**,
        uncheck *LeftHand Traffic*, place the building, then re-enable it afterward.
        - The mod only affects **Left-Hand Traffic saves** — Right-Hand saves are **unaffected**.
        - You can freely switch between LHT and RHT saves without restarting or disabling the mod.
